A approach to generate certificate from wordpress site

The system is designed to use from an wordpress plugin along with this. Theere are mutiple endpoint from where the wordpress site data is accessed and stored in this system's database and generate certificates from those data. 
The plugin is also hosted in another repository.

The initial approach was to use tcpdf or dompdf, but those appoach was not vaiable as those library can not be able to create complex design. Rather decided this approach.
